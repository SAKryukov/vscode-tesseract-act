This package is the Visual Studio Code *extension*, a convenient UI wrapper for Tesseract OCR. It performs Optical Character Recognition of data presented in an image file and opens the recognized result in a text editor.

## Settings:

`tesseract.executableFileLocation`: the location of the Tesseract executable file

## Commands:

* Tesseract: Recognize Text
* Tesseract: Language

The second command allows the user to select a language for recognition. The user's choice is persistently remembered for the current workspace.
