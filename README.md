This package is a Visual Studio Code *extension*, a convenient UI wrapper for Tesseract OCR &mdash; in the VSCode style.
It performs Optical Character Recognition of data found in an image file and opens the recognition result in a text editor.

## Settings:

`tesseract.executableFileLocation`: Tesseract command or the location of the Tesseract executable file<br/>
Default: `tesseract`

## Commands:

* Tesseract: Recognize Text
* Tesseract: Language

The second command allows the user to select a language for recognition. The user's choice is persistently remembered for the current workspace.
